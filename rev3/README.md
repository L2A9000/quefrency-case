## Rev. 3 Case files

The top shell and mid layer files in this folder are to be used with FR4 plates. Each edge has been extended out by 2mm to cover up the sides of the FR4 plates.

The top shell has been designed to be threaded into directly from underneath using M2 screws that are 16mm in length.
